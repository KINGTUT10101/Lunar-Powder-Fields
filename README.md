*This was a project I made for my very first game jam submission in August of 2022. You can download the game on itch.io [here](https://kingtut-10101.itch.io/lunar-powder-fields "here").*

A simple falling sand game set in space! There are 20 particles accessible to the player, and a few more that must be created. This was my submission to LOWREZJAM 2022. I hope you enjoy!
